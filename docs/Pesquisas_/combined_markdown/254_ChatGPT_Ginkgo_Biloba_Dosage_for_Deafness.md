I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Ginkgo biloba is a popular herbal supplement that has been studied for its potential benefits in various conditions, including hearing loss. However, it's important to note that the evidence for its effectiveness in treating sudden unilateral deafness (also known as sudden sensorineural hearing loss) is limited and conflicting.

If you're considering using Ginkgo biloba for this condition, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can evaluate your specific situation and provide appropriate guidance. They will consider factors such as your overall health, medical history, and any medications you may be taking to determine the best course of action.

Dosages of Ginkgo biloba can vary depending on the form of the supplement (e.g., extract, capsule, tablet) and its concentration. Typical dosages range from 120 mg to 240 mg per day, divided into multiple doses. However, it's crucial to follow the dosage instructions provided by the manufacturer or as prescribed by your healthcare provider.

Remember that self-diagnosis and self-medication can be risky, especially when it comes to hearing loss or any health condition. Always seek professional medical advice before starting any new treatment or supplement regimen.

I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays a role in various bodily functions, including nerve and muscle function. It has been studied for its potential benefits in various health conditions, including hearing loss. However, the evidence for its effectiveness in treating sudden unilateral deafness (also known as sudden sensorineural hearing loss) is limited and conflicting.

If you're considering using magnesium for this condition, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional who can evaluate your specific situation and provide appropriate guidance. They will consider factors such as your overall health, medical history, and any medications you may be taking to determine the best course of action.

The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for magnesium varies depending on age, sex, and other factors. For adult men, the RDA is around 400-420 mg per day, while for adult women, it's around 310-320 mg per day. However, these are general guidelines and may not specifically apply to the treatment of sudden unilateral deafness.

If your healthcare provider determines that magnesium supplementation may be beneficial for you, they will recommend an appropriate dosage based on your individual needs. It's crucial to follow their guidance and not exceed the recommended dosage unless advised by a healthcare professional.
