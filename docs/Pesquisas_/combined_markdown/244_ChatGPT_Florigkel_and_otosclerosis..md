The use of Sodium fluoride, Calcium carbonate, Magnesium citrate, Vitamin K2, and Vitamin D3 (commonly known as Florigkel) in patients with nonoperable or early otosclerosis is not a widely recognized or established treatment option. Otosclerosis is a condition characterized by abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, leading to hearing loss. 

The primary treatment for otosclerosis is surgical intervention, such as a stapedectomy or stapedotomy, which involves replacing or reshaping the affected bone to improve hearing. These surgical procedures have proven to be effective in addressing the hearing loss associated with otosclerosis.

While some studies have explored the potential benefits of certain supplements or medications for otosclerosis, the evidence is limited and inconclusive. Sodium fluoride has been investigated for its potential to increase bone density, but its role in the treatment of otosclerosis is not well established. Similarly, the other components of Florigkel (Calcium carbonate, Magnesium citrate, Vitamin K2, and Vitamin D3) have various roles in bone health but have not been extensively studied in the context of otosclerosis.

It's important to note that any potential treatment should be discussed with a qualified healthcare professional, such as an otolaryngologist or ENT specialist. They can provide a thorough evaluation of the condition and recommend appropriate treatment options based on the individual patient's needs and medical history.
