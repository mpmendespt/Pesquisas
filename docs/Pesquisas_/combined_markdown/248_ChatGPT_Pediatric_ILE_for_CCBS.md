I apologize, but as of my last update in September 2021, I do not have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet for the latest information. Consequently, I cannot provide specific details about the pediatric case series and review of the literature on "Intravenous Lipid Emulsion Treatment for Calcium-Channel Blocker Intoxication."

However, I can tell you about the general use of intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy in toxicology. Intravenous lipid emulsion treatment has been studied and utilized in cases of toxicity or poisoning caused by lipophilic substances, including certain medications like calcium-channel blockers. Lipophilic substances have a high affinity for fat, and the administration of intravenous lipid emulsion can help sequester the toxic compound, reducing its availability in the bloodstream and tissues, and potentially mitigating its toxic effects.

The exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is believed that lipid emulsions may form a lipid sink, pulling the lipophilic toxic substance out of the tissues and organs. The toxic substance is then transported in the bloodstream, where it can be eventually metabolized and excreted by the body.

The use of intravenous lipid emulsion therapy in toxicology is still an evolving field, and its efficacy may vary depending on the specific toxic substance involved. It is crucial to note that intravenous lipid emulsion therapy is not a panacea for all types of poisoning, and it should be administered under the guidance of a medical professional experienced in toxicology.

If you are interested in the most up-to-date information on "Intravenous Lipid Emulsion Treatment for Calcium-Channel Blocker Intoxication: Pediatric Case Series and Review of the Literature," I recommend searching for recent medical literature, journals, or academic databases, or consulting a healthcare professional who can access the latest research and information on this topic.

Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy has been used as a potential treatment option in cases of severe calcium-channel blocker (CCB) intoxication. Calcium-channel blockers are a class of medications commonly used to treat conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure), angina (chest pain), and certain cardiac arrhythmias.

In cases of CCB overdose or intoxication, these drugs can lead to significant cardiovascular effects, such as severe bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), and even life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances.

The use of ILE therapy in CCB intoxication is based on the principle of the "lipid sink" effect, as mentioned earlier. When a lipid emulsion is administered intravenously, it acts as a solvent for lipophilic substances like CCBs, essentially forming a temporary lipid phase in the bloodstream where the drug can become trapped. By doing so, the lipid emulsion can reduce the effective concentration of the CCB in the tissues and organs, potentially reversing the toxic effects.

The specific dosing and administration guidelines for ILE therapy in CCB intoxication may vary depending on the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the overdose. The therapy is often considered as an adjunct to conventional supportive care measures, including fluids, vasopressors, and other interventions to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular system.

It's crucial to emphasize that ILE therapy should only be administered under the supervision of medical professionals experienced in managing toxicological emergencies. The decision to use ILE in CCB intoxication should be based on a careful assessment of the individual patient's condition and the potential risks and benefits of this treatment approach.

As with any medical treatment, the efficacy of ILE therapy for CCB intoxication is still an area of ongoing research, and not all cases may respond favorably to this intervention. Therefore, it is essential to follow evidence-based guidelines and protocols while managing cases of CCB overdose or toxicity.

For the most current and detailed information on this topic, I recommend consulting the latest medical literature, guidelines from toxicology societies or organizations, or seeking advice from medical professionals experienced in toxicology and critical care.
