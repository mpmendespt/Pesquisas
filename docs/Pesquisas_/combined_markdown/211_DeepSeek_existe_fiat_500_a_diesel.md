No, the Fiat 500 is not available with a diesel engine. The Fiat 500 is primarily known for its petrol (gasoline) engines, and more recently, it has also been offered with an all-electric version called the Fiat 500e. The car is designed to be a compact, city-friendly vehicle, and diesel engines are generally not used in this model due to their higher emissions and the trend toward more environmentally friendly options like electric and hybrid powertrains.

If you're looking for a small car with a diesel engine, you might need to consider other models or brands, as the Fiat 500 has never been produced with a diesel option.
