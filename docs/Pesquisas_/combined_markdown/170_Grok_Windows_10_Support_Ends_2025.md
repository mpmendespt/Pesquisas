### Windows 10 End of Support: Key Details

Microsoft's support for Windows 10 (all editions, including Home and Pro) will officially end on **October 14, 2025**. This marks the conclusion of the operating system's 10-year lifecycle, which began with its release in July 2015. After this date, Microsoft will no longer provide:
- Free security updates or patches.
- Feature updates or bug fixes.
- Technical assistance for issues.

Your PC will continue to function, but without ongoing security updates, it becomes increasingly vulnerable to malware, viruses, and other threats. Performance may also degrade over time as apps and websites evolve to require newer OS features. As of mid-2025, Windows 10 still holds about 53% global market share, so millions of users are affected.

#### What Happens to Microsoft 365 and Other Apps?
- **Microsoft 365 Apps**: These will continue to run on Windows 10 after October 14, 2025, but support for them on this OS ends on the same date. Security updates for these apps will be extended until October 10, 2028 (three years post-EOL).
- **Office 2016/2019**: Full support ends across all OSes in 2025–2026; they won't receive updates on Windows 10 after EOL.
- **Office 2021/2024 (including LTSC)**: These will run on Windows 10 but lose support post-EOL.
- **Microsoft Store Apps/Games**: Installed ones will work, but no new purchases or in-app buys after EOL.

#### Options After End of Support
If you can't upgrade to Windows 11 (e.g., due to hardware requirements like TPM 2.0 or a compatible CPU), here are your main paths forward. With the current date being September 20, 2025, you have less than a month to decide and act.

| Option | Description | Cost | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|------|
| **Upgrade to Windows 11** | Free if your PC meets requirements (check via PC Health Check app). | Free | Full support until at least 2031; improved security and features. | Not possible on older hardware (e.g., pre-2018 Intel CPUs). |
| **Extended Security Updates (ESU)** | Paid program for security-only patches. For consumers: 1-year option via a $30 one-time fee (enroll by Oct 2026 for coverage until Oct 2026). Businesses: Per-device subscription starting at $61/year (doubles annually, up to $244 in year 3). | $30 (consumer, 1 year); $61–$427 (business, 1–3 years) | Keeps security intact temporarily; easy enrollment via Microsoft account or cloud sync. | Expensive for longer terms; not a full solution—feature updates still end. |
| **Switch to Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or ChromeOS Flex)** | Install a free, open-source OS. ChromeOS Flex is lightweight and Windows-like. | Free | Secure, updated regularly; runs on old hardware. | Learning curve; some Windows apps may need alternatives (e.g., Wine for compatibility). |
| **Buy a New PC** | Get a Windows 11-ready device. | Varies ($300–$1,500+) | Future-proof; eligible for free Windows 11 upgrade. | Upfront cost; data migration needed. |
| **Do Nothing** | Keep using Windows 10 as-is. | Free | No immediate changes. | High security risks; potential app incompatibility. |

#### Recommendations
- **Check Compatibility Now**: Download the PC Health Check tool from Microsoft to see if your device qualifies for Windows 11.
- **Backup Data**: Regardless of your choice, back up files before October 14.
- **Enroll in ESU Early**: For the consumer $30 option, sign up via your Microsoft account settings—it's a "snooze button" but buys time.
- **Enterprise Users**: Contact your IT admin; volume licensing may apply.

### Enrolling in Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESU)

Since Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10 on **October 14, 2025**, the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program is an option to continue receiving critical security patches after this date. Below is a guide to help you enroll and keep your device secure, tailored for both individual consumers and businesses, based on the latest available information as of September 20, 2025.

#### What is the ESU Program?
The ESU program provides security-only updates (no new features or bug fixes) for Windows 10 devices after end-of-support. It’s designed to give users more time to transition to Windows 11 or other solutions.

- **Consumer Option**: A one-time $30 purchase extends security updates for one year, until **October 13, 2026**.
- **Business Option**: A subscription-based model, starting at $61 per device for the first year, doubling annually (up to $244 for year three, ending October 2028).
- **Enrollment Deadline**: For consumers, you must activate by **October 2026** to get the full year of updates. Businesses can enroll earlier via volume licensing.

#### Steps to Enroll in ESU (Consumer)
For individual users, Microsoft has simplified the process to make it accessible through your Microsoft account. Here’s how to enroll:

1. **Verify Eligibility**:
   - Ensure your device is running Windows 10 (Home or Pro, any supported version, e.g., 22H2).
   - Check if upgrading to Windows 11 is an option first (use the PC Health Check app). ESU is a fallback if your hardware doesn’t meet Windows 11 requirements (e.g., TPM 2.0 or compatible CPU).

2. **Access the ESU Enrollment**:
   - Go to **Settings > System > Activation** on your Windows 10 PC.
   - Look for the “Extended Security Updates” section. Microsoft has integrated this into the OS for easy access.
   - Alternatively, visit the Microsoft Store or the official Windows ESU page (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-of-support) and sign in with your Microsoft account.

3. **Purchase the ESU License**:
   - Select the consumer ESU option for a one-time fee of **$30**.
   - Payment is processed via your Microsoft account (credit card, PayPal, or other supported methods).
   - The license is tied to your device and Microsoft account, so ensure you’re signed in on the correct PC.

4. **Activate the License**:
   - After purchase, the ESU license will sync to your device via cloud activation (no manual key entry needed in most cases).
   - If prompted, enter the activation key provided during purchase in **Settings > System > Activation**.
   - Confirm activation by checking for a confirmation message or by running `slmgr /xpr` in Command Prompt (should show “Extended Security Updates enabled”).

5. **Receive Updates**:
   - Security updates will be delivered monthly via Windows Update, starting after October 14, 2025.
   - Ensure your PC remains connected to the internet to download patches.

#### For Businesses
If you’re managing multiple devices or using Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise, the process differs:
- **Contact Microsoft or a Partner**: ESU for businesses is typically handled through Microsoft’s Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) or a Microsoft partner like CDW or SHI.
- **Pricing**: Starts at $61 per device for year one (October 2025–2026), $122 for year two, and $244 for year three. Discounts may apply for volume licensing or cloud-based activation.
- **Activation**: Businesses receive 25-character license keys to activate ESU on each device, or use cloud sync for Microsoft 365-linked devices.
- **Deadline**: Enroll by October 2025 for seamless coverage; later enrollment may still be possible but could miss initial updates.

#### Key Notes
- **Coverage**: ESU provides critical and important security updates only. No new features, non-security fixes, or technical support.
- **Consumer Limitation**: The $30 option is for one year only; there’s no guarantee Microsoft will extend it beyond 2026 for consumers.
- **Backup First**: Before making changes, back up your data to avoid risks during updates or transitions.
- **Alternatives**: If ESU costs are a concern, consider switching to a free Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint) or investing in a Windows 11-compatible PC.

#### Troubleshooting
- **Activation Issues**: If the license doesn’t activate, ensure your Windows 10 copy is genuine (check via `slmgr /dlv` in Command Prompt) and contact Microsoft Support.
- **Not Seeing ESU Option?**: Ensure your OS is updated to the latest version (e.g., 22H2). Check the Microsoft Store or ESU webpage for manual purchase options.

For the latest details or to enroll, visit **https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-of-support** or check your Windows 10 Settings. If you have specific details about your device or setup (e.g., edition, number of devices), I can provide more tailored advice! Would you like help with anything specific, like checking hardware compatibility or exploring Linux options?
